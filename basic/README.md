<div align="center">Basic starter kit for a flexible GraphQL server for TypeScript - based on best practices from the GraphQL community.</div>

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **Static type generation**: TypeScript types for GraphQL queries & mutations are generated in a build step
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (running on MySQL)
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/datamodel.graphql) – easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup

Read more about the idea behind GraphQL boilerplates [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-boilerplates-graphql-create-how-to-setup-a-graphql-project-6428be2f3a5).

## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `typescript-basic` boilerplate
graphql create my-app

# 2. Select `typescript-basic` from the list of boilerplate project names.

# 3. When prompted, deploy the Prisma service to a _public cluster_

# 4. Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

# 5. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000) and open GraphQL Playground
yarn dev
```

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` from [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

> **Note**: We recommend that you're using `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/schema.graphql)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.

## Contributing

The GraphQL boilerplates are maintained by the GraphQL community, with official support from the [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) & [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) teams.
